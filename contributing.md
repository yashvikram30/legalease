## 1. Fork the Repository

Forking means creating your own copy of the project on GitHub.

- Click the **"Fork"** button on the top-right corner of this repository.
- This creates a copy under your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

Cloning brings the code from GitHub to your local computer.

Open your terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```
Replace:
`your-username` with your GitHub username
`project-name` with the name of the repository

Now, go into the project folder:
```bash
cd project-name
```

## 3. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```
Replace `feature-name` with a name related to the change you're making.

## 4. Make Your Changes

Open the project in your code editor, make your changes, and save the files.

```bash
git add .
